# Snowball Structured Product Pricing

This project analyzes and prices an enhanced step-down barrier Snowball structured product issued in December 2022, with the CSI 500 Index as the underlying asset.

The product payoff is decomposed into multiple market scenarios, including early knock-out, survival to maturity without knock-in, and knock-in without knock-out. A Monte Carlo simulation framework under a risk-neutral measure is employed to evaluate the fair value of the product, explicitly modeling path-dependent knock-in and knock-out events, step-down barriers, and cash flow structures.

The project highlights the asymmetric risk–return profile of Snowball products and demonstrates how Monte Carlo methods can be used to price complex structured notes with strong path dependency.
