This project studies an enhanced step-down Snowball structured product issued in December 2022.  
The analysis decomposes the product payoff under different market scenarios and prices the product using a Monte Carlo simulation framework.  
The implementation explicitly models knock-in and knock-out events, step-down barriers, and path-dependent cash flows under a risk-neutral measure.
